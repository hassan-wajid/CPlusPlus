Simple Linked List implementation

Question 01:
Create a program where user can create a Linked List by adding Nodes to the Tail of the Linked List
instead of the Head.
Procedure:
1. Firstly take input from user that is integer value.
2. Then the program will keep asking to add nodes until “n” is not pressed.
3. When “n” is pressed then using while loop the node’s values are shown to user.

Question 02:
Create a program where user can delete a Node(s) from the tail of the Linked List.
Procedure:
1. Firstly take input from user that is integer value.
2. Then the program will keep asking to add nodes until “n” is not pressed.
3. When “n” is pressed then using while loop the node’s values are shown to user.
4. After showing values the program moves to second part where the tail that is last node is 
deleted and the second last node is assigned as tail.
5. At last the values are shown to user where as the last former node cant be seen as before 
deleted.
